        separated by commas in a single locator variable) will be returned as separate 
        locators, returning them in a list format.
        
        For example: if you have an element locator such as "jquery=.hello, .world" where
        the 2 locators ".hello" and ".world" are bundled together, this method will
        remove the jquery= tag and return the string in list format of [.hello, .world],
        which can then be used to iterate through in a for loop and use each single 
        locator on its own.

        >>>[".hello", ".world"]
